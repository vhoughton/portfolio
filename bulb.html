        <h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>Design and implement a registration system to help Bulb identify and support vulnerable customers</p>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>As the product designer and researcher, I identified the issue, advocated to address it, conducted user research, developed prototypes, and ensured continuity in service design across tools and training.</p>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>In 5 months, PSR registrations increased to 7%, with positive feedback and improved accessibility across Bulb's services, creating a robust support framework.</p></div>

      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>As a medium sized energy supplier, Bulb had to maintain a register of users in vulnerable situations. This is called the ‘Priority Services Register’ (PSR).

      </p><p>By "Vulnerable situation" that could be something that made it difficult for them to pay, or a disability that made them be particularly unsafe if they lost gas or electricity connection.
        
       </p><p>Bulb were obliged, by regulation, to have 7% of their customers on the PSR, but Bulb only had 0.17%. They needed to develop a way to identify these users. </p>

      <h2>Defining the Problem Through Discovery</h2>
      <p>The discovery phase, which lasted three weeks, focused on identifying the root causes of inefficiencies within the family tracing service. This involved desk research, expert interviews, and shadowing casework and interviews. Key issues identified included lengthy waiting lists, service users attending interviews without understanding the process, and unnecessary recounting of traumatic events. It was found that 895 out of 2,713 interviews conducted in 2019 should not have occurred, and many could have been significantly shorter.</p>

      <h2>Ideation and Prototyping</h2>
      <p>Building on the insights gathered during discovery, we moved to the ideation phase. This involved generating potential solutions to streamline the referral and interview process. Ideas were refined through workshops and feedback from various stakeholders, including caseworkers, social workers, and service users. There were a big range of ideas but the most impactful centered around the referral process, where we wanted to explore how we could makeWe developed wireframes, user journeys, and low-fidelity prototypes using tools like Figma. The aim was to create a more straightforward and less traumatic experience for the users while reducing the workload on staff.</p>

      <h2>Prototyping from low, to high fidelity</h2>
      <p>During the Alpha phase, we focused on testing the most promising solutions. We created a coded prototype hosted on a testing platform and invited various stakeholders to interact with it. Feedback was collected from local teams and adjustments were made to the prototype. The testing revealed that simplifying the interview process and refining eligibility criteria significantly reduced the number of unnecessary interviews and waiting times. The new approach also ensured that 100% of full-length interviews resulted in an open case, while shorter interviews appropriately directed users to the right services without a lengthy process.</p>

      <h2>Paving the Way for Digital Transformation</h2>
      <p>The success of this project paved the way for broader digital transformation initiatives within the British Red Cross. By demonstrating the value of user-centered design and digital innovation, the project opened up new opportunities for enhancing other services. The changes implemented not only improved efficiency but also underscored the importance of empathy and clarity in service delivery. As a result, 58% of users were prevented from being added to a waitlist for a potentially traumatic appointment they didn’t need, and 36% were referred to a more appropriate service.</p>
