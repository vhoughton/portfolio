      <h3>The challenge</h3>
      <p>Identify which of our 1.25 million customers are eligible for extra support from their energy supplier.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>My role</h3>
      <p>Product and service designer. Making a case for the work, conducting research and designing and delivering the final service.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>What we achieved</h3>
      <p>Proportion of members on the PSR increased from 0.17% to 7% within 5 months of going live.</p>
    </div>

<div class="content">
    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>As a medium sized energy supplier, Bulb had to maintain a register of users in vulnerable situations. This is called the ‘Priority Services Register’ (PSR).</p>

    <p>By "Vulnerable situation" that could be something that made it difficult for them to pay, or a disability that made them be particularly unsafe if they lost gas or electricity connection.</p>
        
    <p>Bulb were obliged, by regulation, to have 7% of their customers on the PSR, but Bulb only had 0.17%. They needed to develop a way to identify these users. </p>
</div>

<div class="text-columns-two">
    <div>
 <h3>The challenge</h3>
 <p>How can we identify which of Bulb’s customers need extra support so that we can:</p>
 <p>Serve them properly <b>and</b> meet our regulatory obligations </p>
       </div>
           <div>
             <h3>Proposed solution</h3>
             <p>A method for users to register their needs online or over the phone. This registration needed to inform energy specialists and local power networks of their situation and trigger extra support when they need it.</p>    
            </div>
       </div>

<div class="content img">
    <h3>Design considerations</h3>
    <div class="project img"><img src="images/09/bulb-considerations.png"alt="Venn diagram showing how the PSR service required both macro service design considerations, as well as micro interaction design considerations to be fully accessible."></div>     

    <p>Designing a service with digital touchpoints for users with access needs created both service and product design considerations to ensure a fully accessible service.</p>
    <p>PSR existed in the intersection of these 2 design spaces more than any other service we offered, this was an opportunity to get it right. 
    </p>
    </div>

       <div class="content">
    <h3>Internal prototyping</h3>
    <p>I began by sketching out the flow on paper, and then in figma before creating a form using a form builder called jot form. The questions were tested by energy specialists who accepted registrations over the phone.  With the energy specialists and operations, we adjusted the questions so it worked for them and their workflow.
        </p>

</div>

<div class= "content">
    <h3>Testing high-fidelity prototypes with real users</h3>
    <p>We then developed a high fidelity prototype to test with real users. We spoke to 6 people, in their homes, with their own technology. They all experienced different kinds of accessibility issues, and were all eligible for the PSR. </p>
    <p>The insights from this research led to the multiple changes before we went live and began communicating about the new service with customers.</p>

</div>

    <div class="text-columns-two">
        <div>
            <h3>Updated our design system to be more accessible</h3>
<p>• Optimised for one handed use on mobile</p>
<p>• Localised state changes to prevent tunnel vision on magnified screens.</p>
<p>• Softened or removed ‘Time taken’ messages which made people feel excluded and slow.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Changed the order of our flow</h3>
          <p>We needed to ask users about their condition, to check they were eligible for the support.

            However, when we asked eligibility questions first, users consistently became irate at being asked personal questions about their disability, before letting them know what services they need.
            
        </p><p>Switching the flow round, asking users what services they needed first, and then checking for eligibility was far more respectful and avoided assumptions.
            </p>
        </div> 
    </div>

    <div class= "content">
        <div class="project img"><img src="images/09/bulb-flow.png"alt="diagram showing how the flow of questions switched from asking about eligibility first, to asking about the users needs first and then asking why"> </div>     
    </div>

    <div class="text-columns-two">
        <div>
            <h3>Removed triggering language</h3>
<p>Addressing people with disabilities who prided themselves on their independence, that they were a ‘priority’ made them feel burdensome. While other language was too soft, making it vague and anxiety inducing for neurodiverse users.</p>
<p>For example, moving from 'Priority support in the event of a power cut' to simply 'Support if you have a powercut"</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Designed and built internal tools and training</h3>
          <p>It was important to users that they only had to ‘tell us once’. We added flags to our internal tools to ensure consistency across our channels.</p><p>Switching the flow round, asking users what services they needed first, and then checking for eligibility was far more respectful and avoided assumptions.</p>
        <p>I also developed training for energy specialists so they knew what they had to do in situations where customers had registered for extra support.         </p>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
</div>
    <div class="text-columns-four">
        <div>
          <p>Proportion of members on the Priority Services Register increased from 0.17% to 7% within 5 months of the registration form going live.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>‘Customers in vulnerable situations’ became a core part of the training program for customer service teams.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Accessibility improvements were implemented to our design system and deployed across all our products.</p>
        </div>  
        <div>
            <p>Our PSR data allowed us to recruit more people for the government’s Warm Home Discount, saving vulnerable customers £140 off their winter bills. </p>
