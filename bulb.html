        <h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>Design and implement a registration system to help Bulb identify and support vulnerable customers</p>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>As the product designer and researcher, I identified the issue, advocated to address it, conducted user research, developed prototypes, and ensured continuity in service design across tools and training.</p>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>In 5 months, PSR registrations increased to 7%, with positive feedback and improved accessibility across Bulb's services, creating a robust support framework.</p></div>

      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>As a medium sized energy supplier, Bulb had to maintain a register of users in vulnerable situations. This is called the ‘Priority Services Register’ (PSR).

      </p><p>By "Vulnerable situation" that could be something that made it difficult for them to pay, or a disability that made them be particularly unsafe if they lost gas or electricity connection.
        
       </p><p>Bulb were obliged, by regulation, to have 7% of their customers on the PSR, but Bulb only had 0.17%. They needed to develop a way to identify these users. </p>

      <h2>Advocating for change</h2>
      <p>I wrote a compelling case to the executive team, emphasizing the urgency of acting on this issue. It was critical to develop a user-friendly process that respected customer privacy and addressed their specific needs.</p>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h2>Prototyping with the customer service team</h2>
      <p>We began by sketching the registration flow and developing prototypes using Figma and JotForm. The initial design was tested with energy specialists who accepted registrations over the phone, allowing us to refine the questions to fit their workflow better.</p>

      <h2>Testing a coded prototype with real users.</h2>
      <p>We conducted usability sessions with six customers in their homes, using their technology. These customers had different accessibility needs and were eligible for the PSR. Their feedback was invaluable in shaping the final design, ensuring it was both accessible and user-friendly.</p>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h2>Explain what you're offering before asking what needs someone has</h2>
<p>We initially asked eligibility questions first, and what services they wanted second. But our research revealed that asking users about their conditions before informing them about available services was perceived as intrusive. We revised the flow to first ask what services the users needed, followed by eligibility questions. This change resulted in a more respectful and user-friendly experience.</p>
</div>


<div class="content-container">
  <h2>Making our content simpler and more inclusive</h2>
<p>The language used in the registration process was carefully adjusted to avoid triggering discomfort or anxiety among users with disabilities. Terms like "priority" were perceived negatively by some users, leading us to adopt simpler, more inclusive language.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-container">
  <h2>Designed internal tools and training to ensure a positive end-to-end experience</h2>
<p>We also designed internal tools and training programs to ensure staff were prepared to support customers effectively. These tools included features like flags that allowed consistent support across different communication channels.</p>
