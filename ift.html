        <h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>Reduce waiting times so that teams can respond to requests quickly and increase the chance of a successful search. </p>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I led the digital transformation projects for the British Red Cross's Refugee services. My title was a service designer, but I led the planning, delivery, research and design for this project.</p>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>Tested and delivered the first digital triage form so that users we couldn't help were quickly notified, reducing the waiting lists and shortening the time waiting for a first appointment. </p></div>

      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>Family tracing is a critical service provided by the British Red Cross, reconnecting families separated by conflict, disaster, or migration. As part of the global Red Cross Red Crescent Movement, the British Red Cross has long been overwhelmed by increasing demand, leading to long waiting lists and an overburdened staff. The goal was to innovate the service delivery process, making it more responsive and efficient while ensuring that service users receive the care and attention they need without unnecessary delays.</p>
      <p>It's important to note that this was also the flagship project for the newly formed digital transformation team. As a consequence, there was a period time leading up to this point, identifying a good opportunity to pilot a new way of working within the Red Cross's refugee services.</p>

      <h2>Defining the Problem Through Discovery</h2>
      <p>The discovery phase, which lasted three weeks, focused on identifying the root causes of inefficiencies within the family tracing service. This involved desk research, expert interviews, and shadowing casework and interviews. Key issues identified included lengthy waiting lists, service users attending interviews without understanding the process, and unnecessary recounting of traumatic events. It was found that 895 out of 2,713 interviews conducted in 2019 should not have occurred, and many could have been significantly shorter.</p>

      <h2>Ideation and Prototyping</h2>
      <p>Building on the insights gathered during discovery, we moved to the ideation phase. This involved generating potential solutions to streamline the referral and interview process. Ideas were refined through workshops and feedback from various stakeholders, including caseworkers, social workers, and service users. There were a big range of ideas but the most impactful centered around the referral process, where we wanted to explore how we could makeWe developed wireframes, user journeys, and low-fidelity prototypes using tools like Figma. The aim was to create a more straightforward and less traumatic experience for the users while reducing the workload on staff.</p>

      <h2>Alpha Testing</h2>
      <p>During the Alpha phase, we focused on testing the most promising solutions. We created a coded prototype hosted on a testing platform and invited various stakeholders to interact with it. Feedback was collected from local teams and adjustments were made to the prototype. The testing revealed that simplifying the interview process and refining eligibility criteria significantly reduced the number of unnecessary interviews and waiting times. The new approach also ensured that 100% of full-length interviews resulted in an open case, while shorter interviews appropriately directed users to the right services without a lengthy process.</p>

      <h2>Paving the Way for Digital Transformation</h2>
      <p>The success of this project paved the way for broader digital transformation initiatives within the British Red Cross. By demonstrating the value of user-centered design and digital innovation, the project opened up new opportunities for enhancing other services. The changes implemented not only improved efficiency but also underscored the importance of empathy and clarity in service delivery. As a result, 58% of users were prevented from being added to a waitlist for a potentially traumatic appointment they didnâ€™t need, and 36% were referred to a more appropriate service.</p>
