      <h3>The challenge</h3>
    <p>How might we safely marry Ukrainian’s need for refuge with the generosity of the British public?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>My role</h3>
      <p>Lead designer for the digital delivery team.</p>
      <p>Converting policy ideas into a vision, a strategy and prototypes, through to a tested service.</p>

    <div>
      <h3>What we achieved</h3>
      <p>Over 115,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK to a host family.</p>
      <p>Every arrival notified the local authority so they could safeguard the host and the guest.</p>

    <h3>The Service</h3>
    <p>In response to the war in the Ukraine, with a lack of available housing, the UK government decided to set up a visa scheme where ukrainians could seek refuge in the UK by staying with host families. I worked as the lead designer in the digital team to make this idea a reality and safeguard all guests and hosts.</p>

<div class="content">
    <h3>Finding new hosts</h3>
    <p>This case study will focus on solving the problems around finding a new host.</p>
<p>Fast forward 5 months, and the most pressing need was to find new hosts for guests whose initial host didn’t work out, and prevent homelessness. 
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we had a list of 250,000 people who had registered to be a host when the crisis started, but many of which had not ‘converted’ to becoming a host. </p>
</div> 

<div class="content">
    <h3>We conducted user research to identify bottlenecks in our 'Rematching' service</h3>
    <div class="project img"><img src="images/09/HFU-service-bottleneck.png" alt="**"></div>     
    <p>We did a round of remote interviews with potential hosts and Local Authority caseworkers, alongside quantitative analysis of existing data we had on prospective hosts. 
    </p>
    <p>Local authorities told us the list they are working from was low quality.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="content">
    <h3>We identified 3 mindsets in our hosts</h3>
    <p>Hands on hosts who registered with the government but took matters in to their own hands to find a host when they didn't hear anything. Hosts on hold, who had registered but were waiting for someone to match them with a host, and Hesitant Hosts who had signed up optimistically, but in practice their lives weren't in the right place to take on a hosting relationship.</p>

<div class="text-columns-two">
    <div>
    <h3>Build more friction into the registration flow</h3>
    <p>The registration flow was a frictionless way to register interest in becoming a host, which led to high volume of unprepared hosts, either because they hadn’t thought it through and weren’t ready (hopeful hosts), or it didn’t give hosts on hold enough direction on what to do next. </p>
   </div>
       <div>
         <h3>Local authorities needed</h3>
         <p>We needed to improve our internal tools so that the directory of potential hosts are:</p>
         <p>• Easy to search for my area and size</p>
         <p>• Filled with hosts who are prepared for the undertaking.</p>
       </div>
   </div>


<div class="content">
    <h3>Potential improvements to the registration flow</h3>
    <div class="project img"><img src="images/09/HFU-improvements.png" alt="**"></div>
    <p>I led workshops with a cross-disciplinary group of stakeholders from policy and delivery. I shared the insights from our users and we came up with a wide range of potential solutions. We ended up with 3 key approaches to increasing the quality of potential hosts.</p>
    <p>Giving people upfront content, asking them reflective questions to slow down the process and let them think things through, and provide much clearer next steps, so they know what they need to do next.</p>

    <h3>Sketching and prototyping</h3>
    <p>To communicate our ideas early with policy teams and ditch bad ideas quickly, we started with wireframes and sketches. We then took our good ideas and used the gov.uk kit to create realistic testing experiences for users.   </p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
</div>
<div class="text-columns">
    <div>
      <p>We reduced the number of people on the list of potential hosts that weren’t prepared for the responsibility. Making it easier for caseworkers to find appropriate hosts.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The hosting service as a whole is being reused for other refugee groups.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We won delivery of the year at Made Tech due to the speed and quality of delivery under great public scrutiny.</p>
