        <h2>The brief</h2>
        <br><p>Design and deliver the first scheme to UK residents to host refugees in their homes.</p>
       </div>

       <div class="content-container">
      <h2>My role</h2>
      <p>Lead designer for the digital delivery team. Converting policy ideas into a vision, strategy, and prototype, resulting in a tested service.</p>
       </div>

       <div class="content-container">      
       <h2>Outcome</h2>
       <br> <p>Over 150,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK under the scheme. Our service received almost no defects and was used and updated, with outputs as finding new accommodation where necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-container">

    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>The service</h2>
        <p>1. I ensured the first match was safe, by translating visa applications into new cases for local authorities, where they would manage the safeguarding of both hosts and guests.</p>
        <p>2. Found new hosts when the first hosting relationship broke down.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-container">

    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>Discovery research</h2>
        <p>We did a round of remote interviews with potential hosts and Local Authority caseworkers, alongside quantitative analysis of existing data we had on prospective hosts.</p> 
        <p>Local authorities told us the list they are working from was low quality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>One of our biggest challenges</h2>
        <p>The second part of the service, where the arrivals were found a new host, proved most difficult. In the rare, but important cases where guests were forced out of their hosts home and presented as homeless, local authorities were struggling to find replacement homes at speed. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/hfu-rematching-map.jpg" alt="A service map specificaly on our rematching service. The bottleneck is when caseworkers tried to find an appropriate host and it took ages to find one, if at all, from the hosts available.">
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>Not all hosts were ready to take on a guest</h2>
        <p>Through our research, we identified 3 mindsets in our prospective hosts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Hands on hosts:</strong> who are already hosting through their own means, and aren’t available to host more.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Hosts on hold:</strong> who were interested, and had filled in a registration form, but were waiting to be contacted.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Hopeful hosts:</strong> registered their interest with optimism, but in reality wouldn’t feel up for it if the opportunity arose.
            </li>
        </ol>        

    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>Sketching and prototyping</h2>
        <p>We worked to improve our registration flow to increase the quality of hosts available by adding</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Upfront guidance and case studies</strong> to help people prepare for hosting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reflective questions</strong> to invite users to consider if their home and lifestyle was compatible with hosting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Clearer next steps</strong> so users knew what would happen next and when they needed to be proactive.
            </li>
        </ol>        
    </div>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/hfu-sketches.jpg" alt="digital sketches of the host registration journey from seeing an advert to completing the registration form">
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>What we learned from prototyping</h2>
        <p><strong>Upfront guidance wasn't helpful</strong><br>Some users found the case studies hard to apply to their current lives. Most users failed to read any of the content at all and went straight to the form. </p>
            <p><strong>But our reflective questions worked well:</strong><br>Users paused and thought. Some told us that they may talk to the rest of their household before completing the form. </p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>Impact on our rematching service</h2>
        <p>We reduced the number of people on the list of potential hosts that weren’t prepared for the responsibility. This meant that caseworkers reported it was easier to find hosts from their list.</p>
        <p>We had also adapted the questions, removing unnecessary data, and adjusting questions so caseworkers found the data easier to filter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>The wider project</h2>
        <p>Finding guests new hosts was just one part of the wider service of which I led design and strategy for a wide range of projects to build, expand and improve the service.</p>
        <p>The scheme has since been repurposed to find homes for other refugees currently stuck in costly and uncomfortable hotels.</p>
        <p>We won “Delivery of the Year” at Made Tech, and I designed our initial rapid response team stickers to honour the intensely hard work that went into those first 6 months.</p>
