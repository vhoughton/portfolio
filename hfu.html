    <p>I led the design of a rapid-response government service for Ukrainian refugees to find safe host families in the UK to live with. This case study looks at the work we did to improve the quality of hosts for when a first match breaks down.    </p>

        <h2>The service did 2 things</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Ensured the first match was safe, by translating visa applications into new cases for local authorities, where they would manage the safeguarding of both hosts and guests.
            </li>
            <li>
                Found new hosts when the first hosting relationship broke down.            </li>
        </ol>     
   
    </div>

    <div class="image-container">

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>Finding replacement hosts was proving paticularly challenging</h2>
        <p>The second part of the service, where the arrivals were found a new host, proved most difficult. In the rare, but important cases where guests were forced out of their hosts home and presented as homeless, local authorities were struggling to find replacement homes at speed. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>We wanted to understand why it was hard to find replacement hosts</h2>
        <p>We did a round of remote interviews with potential hosts and Local Authority caseworkers, alongside quantitative analysis of existing data we had on prospective hosts.</p> 
        <p>Local authorities told us the list they are working from was low quality.</p>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>Not all hosts were ready to take on a guest</h2>
        <p>Through our research, we identified 3 mindsets in our prospective hosts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Hands on hosts:</strong> who are already hosting through their own means, and aren’t available to host more.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Hosts on hold:</strong> who were interested, and had filled in a registration form, but were waiting to be contacted.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Hopeful hosts:</strong> registered their interest with optimism, but in reality wouldn’t feel up for it if the opportunity arose.
            </li>
        </ol> 
        <p>We worked on making local authority lists easier to filter by geography and qualities. But we also set out to improve the registration flow so that it led to a higher quality list in the first place.</p>       

    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>Ideas we tested to improve the registration flow</h2>
        <p>We worked to improve our registration flow to increase the quality of hosts available by adding</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Upfront guidance and case studies</strong> to help people prepare for hosting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reflective questions</strong> to invite users to consider if their home and lifestyle was compatible with hosting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Clearer next steps</strong> so users knew what would happen next and when they needed to be proactive.
            </li>
        </ol>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>Upfront guidance tested poorly, but our reflective questions worked well</h2>
        <p>Some users found the case studies hard to apply to their current lives. But most users failed to read any of the content at all and went straight to the form. </p>
        <p>Our reflective questions worked well: Users paused, thought and made better descriptions. </p>
        <p class="quote">"On second thoughts, I think I'd need to talk this through with my husband a bit more"</p>
   <p>We took these findings and refined our ideas, tested them a bit more, until we were ready to release the new changes. There were a lot of cooks and interest in this project, from a local, voluntary, comms and policy perspective, so it required a lot of stakeholder management to get everything signed off in the end.</p>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>Impact on our rematching service</h2>
        <p>We reduced the number of people on the list of potential hosts that weren’t prepared for the responsibility. This meant that caseworkers reported it was easier to find hosts from their list.</p>
        <p>We had also adapted the questions, removing unnecessary data, and adjusting questions so caseworkers found the data easier to filter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>The wider project</h2>
        <p>Finding guests new hosts was just one part of the wider service of which I led design and strategy for a wide range of projects to build, expand and improve the service.</p>
        <p>The scheme has since been repurposed to find homes for other refugees currently stuck in costly and uncomfortable hotels.</p>
        <p>We won “Delivery of the Year” at Made Tech, and I designed our initial rapid response team stickers to honour the intensely hard work that went into those first 6 months.</p>
