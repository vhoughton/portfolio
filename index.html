  <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
  <p class="section-p">
  I help purpose-driven organisations design services that work. I have over 8 years experience designing and delivering products and services across public sector, charity and start-up contexts.</p>
  <p class="section-p">I am experienced in the practical work of designing, prototyping and delivering new services, as well as the more foundational work of setting strategy, defining policy, building teams and creative direction.
  </p class="section-p">
  <p class="section-p">I’m interested in working with organisations shifting us towards a fairer world with brighter futures. I'm comfortable in multi-disciplinary roles that are a bit fuzzy around the edges, so if you think I can help, send me an email vickyhp.work@gmail.com or a message on linkedin.

<p class="section-p"><strong>“Led by user needs”… How can we ensure this happens in practice?</strong> </p>
  <p class="section-p">Our current situation at the Red Cross will be familiar to lots of other large organisations. We’ve built giant services, that have...</p>

<p class="section-p"><strong>What we learned about how caseworkers learn</strong> </p>
