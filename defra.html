    <p>I was the designer responsible for looking at the end to end service for the Sustainable Farming Initiative. A service for applying for grants to improve the environmental health of your farm.</p>
    <p>In particular there was a gap in understanding what the back-end processes would look like. With a user researcher we did a discovery and an alpha phase exploring internal tooling for processing applications.</p>
    <p>There was a lot of resistance at exploring custom made internal tools, but the intial prototypes of some common processes opened up conversations about how we could move away from legacy systems and start building our own tech.</p>
